        <h1>Welcome to Future World</h1>
        <h2>A Sam Roble Project</h2>
        <p1>Future World is half of the two-land park at Epcot Center at Walt Disney World Resot, the other land being The World Showcase. Future World is a collective of attractions and rides focusing on the thesis of tomorrow; Striving for inventiveness and zero complacency for yesterday. At the entrance of the land is Spaceship Earth, the iconic geodesic sphere that acts as the park's weenie. (Weenie is a term used by Imagineers to describe the large iconic building of the park, like Cinderella’s Castle)</p1>
        <p2>Future World, and Epcot Center at large, was designed to be a permanent World’s Fair. While showcasing the future is the center of the thesis, exploring the past and appreciating how technology has advanced throughout civilization is a core theme as well. </p2>
